# [*R Blood*](https://github.com/avikram553/Rblood)
&nbsp;&nbsp;__This project is more of an awareness and social help kind of thing. It is basically a webapp which will find out the blood donor present in recepient city.Every visitor would have to make an account on our portal and have to provide with their details which will be stored in the database and will be displayed when someone needs blood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;__Whenever any recipient searches for a donor a list will be displayed and an email will get invoked to all the available donors along with the important information of recepient.
